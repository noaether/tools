## keymanagement.sh
This script is a shell script that is used to securely store and retrieve sensitive information, such as encryption keys, authentication credentials, and server fingerprints. The script starts by starting an ssh-agent and then prompts the user for the passwords for four different types of keys: SSH, SSL, fingerprint, and AES. The user input for the passwords is stored in the variables `SSH_KEYPASS`, `SSL_KEYPASS`, `FINGERPRINT_KEYPASS`, and `AES_KEYPASS` respectively. The script then uses the `openssl` command to decrypt sensitive information, such as the private key, using the AES encryption and the entered password. The decrypted information is stored in temporary files, which are created using the `mktemp` command. The script also uses the `scp` command to securely copy the encrypted API keys from a remote server to the local machine. The API keys are then decrypted using the `openssl` command and the entered password. The script includes a function `check_keys` that checks if the required keys are present in the decrypted API keys file. If the keys are present, the function returns their value, otherwise it returns an error message.
